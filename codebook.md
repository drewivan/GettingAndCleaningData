Codebook:

Two files are generated:

alldata.txt and summarydata.txt

The columns in alldata.txt are as follows:
subject: the test subject's numeric idenifier
activity: one of the following activity labels: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
followed by 86 columns of mean and standard deviation data as defined in the project's codebook. 
see the files feature_info.txt and features.txt for descriptions of the columns.

For summarydata.txt, the columns are the same; however, the rows have been summarized by calculating the mean for 
all observations, grouped by subject and activity.
